1. Run tests.py

2. If all ok, go to server path and run server.py

3. Go to client path and run some clientns to read (python client.py r) and some to write (python client.py w)

Now write messages on w-clients and you will get it on r-clients.

Subprocess module is using in tests.py

Client and server both have logs wich were designed by using Log class (log.py) as decorator.
